# Python-Basic_2 🐍

A hands-on collection of Python scripts and examples, built to strengthen your fundamentals and practical skills in Python programming.

## 🧭 Overview

This repo is a continuation of Python-Basics, offering concise code snippets and exercises that reinforce essential Python concepts like control flow, functions, OOP, file I/O, and more.

## 📂 What's Inside

- **Python scripts** (`.py` files) covering topics such as:
  - Fundamental types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries
  - Control structures: `if`, `for`, `while`, and comprehensions
  - Functions (with arguments, defaults, and docstrings)
  - Classes and object-oriented programming basics
  - File handling: reading, writing, exception management

- **Exercises**: small challenges at the end of scripts to test and deepen understanding.

- **Comments and explanations**: most scripts include detailed inline comments and docstrings.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Python beginners looking to go beyond "hello world"
- Students strengthening their programming logic
- Developers refreshing core Python skills

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agarwaljubin/Python-Basic_2.git
   cd Python-Basic_2
Optionally set up a virtual environment

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
Run any script

bash
Copy
Edit
python example_script.py
(No external dependencies—these use only built‑in Python libraries.)

Complete exercises

Explore the challenge comments within each script and test your skills.

🛠️ Learning Path
Progress through the scripts in order:

Basic types & operations: Core data structures and basic syntax

Control flow: Loops, conditionals, list comprehensions

Functions: Definitions, arguments, return values, docstrings

Modules & imports: Organizing reusable code

Classes & OOP: Defining classes, methods, instances

File I/O & exceptions: Reading/writing files with error handling

By the end, you'll have a strong grasp of Python essentials.
